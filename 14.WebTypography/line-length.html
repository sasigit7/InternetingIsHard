      <h2>Manageable Line Length</h2>
      <p>You should try to limit the length of your lines to approximately 80
        characters or less. It reduces strain on the reader’s eyes, since they don’t
        need to move back and forth as much. It also helps prevent them from jumping
        to the wrong line when they get to the end of the previous line. The end
        result is that it’s easier for visitors to digest your content.</p>

      <h2>Not-So-Manageable Line Length</h2>
      <p>This section contains the same text as the previous one, but with a line
        length that always stretches to the size of the browser. It’s more difficult
        to read when your browser window is wide.</p>
