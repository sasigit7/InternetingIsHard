      <h2>Gothic/Blackletter</h2>

      <p>When Gutenburg invented the printing press in 1440, he wanted to
        mass-produce the hand-drawn caligraphy of monks. It’s hard to read if
        you’re not a medieval scholar, so don’t use it unless you’re really trying
        to recreate the middle ages.</p>

    </section>

    <section class='section section--gray old-style'>
      <h2>Old Style Serif</h2>

      <p>Old style fonts were the first “modern” fonts. They’re soft, warm, and
        still almost feel hand-drawn. They’re built for legibility, which make them
        fantastic text fonts. Use them when you want to evoke the Renaissance.</p>
    </section>

    <section class='section section--gray transitional'>
      <h2>Transitional Serif</h2>

      <p>Make old-style fonts less hand-drawn and chop the serifs off at right
        angles, and you get transitional fonts. This was the predominant font
        during the founding of the United States and has strong connotations with
        neoclassical architecture and art.</p>
    </section>


    <section class='section section--gray didot'>
      <h2>Didot Serif</h2>

      <p>Didot fonts create a stark contrast between thick vertical strokes and
        very thin horizontal ones. They have an air of elegance about them, which
        is why they’re popular fonts for luxury brands and fasion magazines. Not so
        great as text fonts though.</p>
    </section>


    <section class='section section--gray slab'>
      <h2>Slab Serif</h2>

      <p>Take a Didot font, make all the strokes the same width, and you get a
        slab serif. They’re a font created during the industrial revolution,
        primarly for titles, not for long runs of text.</p>
    </section>


    <section class='section section--gray fat-face'>
      <h2>Fat Face Serif</h2>

      <p>The industrial revolution brought about a need to advertise the
        resulting surplus of goods. Making slab serifs fonts really thick was a
        good way to stand out. You’ll also recognize fat face serifs in want-ads
        from the Westward Expansion in the United States.</p>

    </section>

    <section class='section section--gray grotesque'>
      <h2>Grotesque Sans Serif</h2>

      <p>Slab serif fonts without the serifs don’t have much character, but that
        makes them really versatile, right? Max Miedinger certainly thought so when
        he invented Helvetica in 1957.</p>

    </section>

    <section class='section section--gray geometric'>
      <h2>Geometric Sans Serif</h2>

      <p>Apply Bauhaus design aesthetics to typography, and you get geometric
        sans serif fonts. They’re like Grotesque fonts, but have rounder forms.
        They’re a classically modern font for the 1940s and 50s, but they’re hard
        to read, making them less suitable as text fonts.</p>

    </section>

    <section class='section section--gray humansit'>
      <h2>Humanist Sans Serif</h2>

      <p>Geometric sans serif fonts lost their human character, so why not add a
        little hint of old-style serif into a sans serif font? You get a modern
        font that’s easy-to-read and has enough character to stand on its own as a
        display font.</p>

    </section>

    <section class='section section--gray display'>
      <h2>Display</h2>

      <p>Now that we have web fonts, the sky’s the limit with how fancy we can
        get with our fonts. The last decade has seen an explosion in fancy font
        faces, many of which are best-suited for titles. These are great for adding
        unique character to a website’s headings.</p>

    </section>

    <section class='section section--gray monospace'>
      <h2>Monospace</h2>

      <p>Monospace fonts are a fluke of history. They were designed specifically
        for the technical limitations of typewriters, ignoring many of the
        typographic principles that make for legible text. Don’t use them unless
        you’re marking up code snippets.</p>
